# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions. Examples include:
- Classification: Categorizing data into predefined classes
- Regression: Predicting continuous numerical values

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Common techniques include:
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves agents learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

## Key Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression** - Predicts continuous outcomes based on linear relationships
2. **Decision Trees** - Tree-like structures for classification and regression
3. **Random Forests** - Ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy
4. **Neural Networks** - Inspired by biological neurons, excellent for complex patterns
5. **Support Vector Machines** - Effective for high-dimensional classification

## Model Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error for regression tasks
